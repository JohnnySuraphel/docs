There are two approachs to install RAAD the following are:

### 1. WSL Installation 

**What is WSL?**

WSL, or Windows Subsystem for Linux, is a feature of Windows 10 and 11 that allows you to run Linux distributions on your Windows computer. This means that you can use all of the Linux tools and commands that you are familiar with, without having to switch to a different operating system.

    To do this paste  `wsl --install` on the command prompt opened on step one and press `enter`


    Check [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for more information
**To install RAAD on WSL and Ubuntu, follow these steps:**

### 2. Remote Installation 

- Within the terminal, enter the following command, replacing [username] with the username of the remote user and [ip-address] with the IP address or domain name of the remote server.

`
ssh [username]@[ip-address]
`

The SSH client attempts to connect to the remote server over port 22 (the default SSH port).

- When you connect with a server for the first time, the SSH client on Windows 10 prompts you to check and verify the host key’s fingerprint. This is normal, and results in output similar to:

`
The authenticity of host ‘example.com (93.184.216.34)’ can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:d029f87e3d80f8fd9b1be67c7426b4cc1ff47b4a9d0a84.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
`

Accept the prompt by entering `y` or `yes`, which results in a one-time warning that is similar to:

`
Warning: Permanently added 'example' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
`

Once you have successfully connected, your terminal should be using the remote shell environment for the server. Your command prompt should now show the username and hostname configured for the server. You can now run any commands that you have available on that server. This includes many of the basic Linux commands, such as ls, cd, rm, and those covered in Using the Terminal guide. Getting to know these commands will help you navigate around your server.


### Finally all you need to get up and running is to execute the following:

`
curl -k https://uat.raad.moh.gov.so/download/install-raad.sh | bash
`

### Initialization time

The first time you install RAAD, it will take about 5 to 10 minutes to initialize. It create some necessary files and folders, and activate all of its modules. After the first initialization, the software will start up much faster.


### Post-Installation Steps

Once RAAD is installed, you will need to complete the following steps:



1. Configure RAAD by following the steps in the RAAD documentation.
2. Create user accounts for your users.
3. Train your users on how to use RAAD.


## Access the Application

Open your browser (Chrome or Firefox) and access the following applications *replace `<machine-ip>` with `localhost` if you are running RAAD on a local machine. And use the following credentials:
