## Requirements

To deploy the RAAD installer, you will need:

* A CentOS cloud-based server having at least 4GB of RAM and 20GB of free disk space
* The IP address of the CentOS server
* The username and password for the CentOS server
* Root privileges on the system
* The RAAD installer package
* Chrome or Firefox web browser installed


## Installation

RAAD can be install with simple steps using the installer package.

### Ubuntu Installation 

- Within the terminal, enter the following command, replacing [username] with the username of the remote user and [ip-address] with the IP address or domain name of the remote server.

`
ssh [username]@[ip-address]
`

The SSH client attempts to connect to the remote server over port 22 (the default SSH port).

- When you connect with a server for the first time, the SSH client on Windows 10 prompts you to check and verify the host key’s fingerprint. This is normal, and results in output similar to:

`
The authenticity of host ‘example.com (93.184.216.34)’ can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:d029f87e3d80f8fd9b1be67c7426b4cc1ff47b4a9d0a84.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
`

Accept the prompt by entering `y` or `yes`, which results in a one-time warning that is similar to:

`
Warning: Permanently added 'example' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
`

Once you have successfully connected, your terminal should be using the remote shell environment for the server. Your command prompt should now show the username and hostname configured for the server. You can now run any commands that you have available on that server. This includes many of the basic Linux commands, such as ls, cd, rm, and those covered in Using the Terminal guide. Getting to know these commands will help you navigate around your server.


### Finally all you need to get up and running is to execute the following:

`
curl -k https://uat.raad.moh.gov.so/2gv7o-l2e4q/download/install-raad.sh | sudo bash
`

When prompted with a github token like the following:

`
Password for 'https://GitHubUser@github.com':
`

Paste `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` and press enter

### Upgrading RAAD

RAAD can be upgraded to the newest version using the following simple steps.

- Update using `raad-update` command

`
sudo bash /opt/ehr_docker/bin/raad-update
`

- When prompted with a github token like the following:

`
Password for 'https://GitHubUser@github.com':
`

Paste `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` and press enter

### Initialization time

The first time you install RAAD, it will take about 5 to 10 minutes to initialize. It create some necessary files and folders, and activate all of its modules. After the first initialization, the software will start up much faster.
