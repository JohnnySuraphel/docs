## Backup and Restore Architecture

RAAD backup and and restore is an implementation to routinely keep backups of all modules' Databases and store both locally and automatically sync to a remote storage.

### Local Backup
Local backup and restore is the process of creating and storing backups on local storage. This is done through taking a full backup everyday to able to restore from any timeline.

### Remote Backup Sync
Remote backup sync is an implementation to automatically sync backups to a remote storage with Facility ID. This can be extremely resourcesful in the case of local disk corruption.

## User Guide

This is a detailed guide on how to backup databases both manually and automatic. And a step by step guide on how to restore backups. 

To go ahead we will need to update RAAD with running the following command `sudo bash /opt/ehr_docker/bin/raad-update`. 

### Configure Remote Backup Sync
1. Run the script to configure remote storage authentication
        
        `sudo bash /opt/ehr_docker/bin/configure-online-backup`

2. You will be prompted with the following `Please enter the Azure token key:`. Paste the Azure token key provided and hit `enter`

        - Now remote backup sync will be automatically activated

### Manual and Automatic backup

1. Manual Backup
Manual backup can be easily done with running the command `sudo bash /opt/ehr_backup/bin/manual_backup` and can be found in `/opt/backups`

2. Automatic Backup
Automatic backup are done routinely full backup every day and can be accessed in `/opt/backups`
Restoring backup. 

        - Note: Replace all `<date_and_time>` with the corresponding date and time of the backup you want to restore

1. CD into backup dir

        `
        cd /opt/backups	
        `

2. Decompress the .GZ dump:

        `
        sudo gunzip db_backup_<date_and_time>.gz
        `

        `
        sudo gunzip openelis_db_backup_<date_and_time>.gz
        `

3. Restore the dump into the MySQL database. Replace `<password>` with mysql root password: 

        - Note: Use the decompressed backup file instead of the original .gz file

        `
        cat db_backup_<date_and_time> | sudo docker exec -i docker_compose-openmrsdb-1 mysql -u root -D openmrs -p'<password>'
        `

        `
        cat openelis_db_backup_<date_and_time> | sudo docker exec -i docker_compose-openelisdb-1 psql -Uclinlims clinlims
        `

4. Restart the MySQL Docker container:

        `
        sudo docker restart $(sudo docker ps -aq)
        `

5. Wait for initialization to finish. This might take 5-15 minutes depending thee resource of machine
